Note down your Client ID and Client Secret.
Open `LinkedInManager` file to add the following entries like:


```swift
struct LinkedInConstants {
    
    static let CLIENT_ID = "<linkedin_client_id>"
    static let CLIENT_SECRET = "<linkedin_client_secret>"
    static let REDIRECT_URI = "<your_domain>.oauth/oauth"
    static let SCOPE = "r_liteprofile%20r_emailaddress"
    
    static let AUTHURL = "https://www.linkedin.com/oauth/v2/authorization"
    static let TOKENURL = "https://www.linkedin.com/oauth/v2/accessToken"
}

```

## LinkedIn Usage


```swift

    @IBAction func btnLinkedinLogin(_ sender: UIButton) {
        let vc = LinkedInManagerViewController()
        vc.delegate = self
        vc.linkedInAuthVC(parent: self)
    }

```



## Slack Configuration
To enable Slack login, follow these steps:

Visit the Slack API [Console](https://api.slack.com/apps) and create a new app.
Note down your Client ID and Client Secret.
Open `SlackManager` file to add the following entries like:


```swift
struct SlackConstants {
    
    static let CLIENT_ID = "<client_id>"
    static let CLIENT_SECRET = "<client_secret>"
    static let REDIRECT_URI = ""
    static let SCOPE =   "identity.basic,identity.email,identity.avatar"
    
    static let AUTHURL = "https://slack.com/oauth/v2/authorize"
    static let TOKENURL = "https://slack.com/api/oauth.v2.access"
    static let USERINFO = "https://slack.com/api/users.identity"
}

```

## Slack Usage


```swift

        @IBAction func btnSlackLogin(_ sender: UIButton) {
        let vc = SlackManagerViewController()
        vc.delegate = self
        vc.slackAuthVC(parent: self)
